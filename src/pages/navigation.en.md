# Navigation project

The navigation project aims to improve the navigation of people with visual impairments.

For this it is divided into several modules:
+ a module allowing the generation of a graph from a plan
+ a module allowing to manually place points of interest on a map
+ a module allowing navigation in a map

The route used in navigation has the following specifics:
+ It can be multi-stage (by connecting 2 points of interest of different stages between them)
+ It can be defined in several times
+ With changeable precision

Navigation is intended to focus on the user by providing the information necessary for it:
+ audio indication of direction and distance to next step
+ prevention when crossing doors
+ indication of the nearest point of interest
