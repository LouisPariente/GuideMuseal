# Navigation project

The navigation project aims to improve the navigation of people with visual impairments.

For this it is divided into several modules:
+ a module allowing the generation of a graph from a plan
+ a module allowing to manually place points of interest on a map
+ a module allowing navigation in a map

The route used in navigation has the following specifics:
+ It can be multi-storey (by connecting 2 points of interest located on different storeys)
+ It can be defined in several sections in succession
+ It can have a modifiable resolution (zoom)

Navigation is centered on the user (ego-centered) by providing him with the necessary information:
+ audio indication of the direction and the distance to the next stage (node ​​of the navigation graph)
+ preventive indication before crossing a door
+ indication of the nearest point of interest
